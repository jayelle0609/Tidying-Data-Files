# 🌍 Travel Expense Visualizations in Python

A playful collection of Python-powered visualizations to track trips, budgets, 
and questionable life decisions because data can make your adventures look *way more organized than they actually are*.  

## Projects

1. **Holiday Budget Tracker** 💸  
   Visualizing where my money goes on trips (spoiler: I am spending way too much!! 🥲).  

2. **Convincing a Friend for a Trip Extension** ✈️  
   Showing low opportunity cost to justify extra vacation days.  

## Tools
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy 📊  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn & Plotly🎨  

## Notes
- Just for fun, personal use, and aesthetic chaos.  
- All charts are more about storytelling than financial advice.
- Created purely out of my genuine love for charting and to organize my thoughts
- It truly helped me **visualize the damage**... my love for travel is doing to my wallet 🥲🥲🥲
